 *                                                                             *
 * Northumbria University's Mars rover has landed successfully.                 *
 * It is now your job to take over the controls, and start exploring.          *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 1: To move the rover, type moveRight() into the main function below.   *
 * Step 2: Try out all 4 directions, you can move up, down, right and left.    *
 * 
 * HINT:   moveRight() moves the rover right. moveUp() moves the rover up...   *
 *                                                                             *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *                                                                             *
 * Now that you've got hang of the controls, let's see if                      *
 * you can guide the rover to the target location.                             *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 3: Take a look at the level, to see where you need to go               *
 * Step 4: Program the rover below to drive onto the target                    *
