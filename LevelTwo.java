 *                                                                             *
 * The rover comes equipped with a scanner, to help you avoid                  *
 * crashing into rocks. To scan, we can use rightIsSafe() to detect if the     *
 * tile to the right is safe to move into.                                     *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 1: Using an IF statement, try moving UP, using this safety check.      *
 *                                                                             *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *                                                                             *
 * You probably didn't move, that's good, you didn't crash!                    *
 * 
 * What if we did want to move? For example, if there's a rock                 *
 * to our right, we might want to move up, and try to go around it.            *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 2: Change your program to drive around the rock, using IF statements.  *
