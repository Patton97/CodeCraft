 *                                                                             *
 * Now that we've learned how to scan for rocks, let's do some exploring.      *
 * You've probably noticed the cave entrance to your right - drive in, safely. *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 1: Drive into the cave                                                 *
 *                                                                             *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *                                                                             *
 * That was probably boring, and took a lot of repeating the same code.        *
 *                                                                             *
 * Good news! There's a neater, simpler way to program these                   *
 * repetitive tasks: "loops". Rather than using several IF statements one      *
 * after another, we can put it all inside of a loop.                          *                                                                        *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 2: Change your code to use a loop instead                              *
