/**
 * LEVEL THREE: Escape the Cave!
 * 
 * NU-Rover has got itself stuck in a cave, help it escape.
 * 
 * Step 1: Take a look at the level first, to see where you need to go
 * Step 2: Program the rover below to drive out of the cave
 * 
 * That was probably boring, and took a while to code. 
 * Good news! There's a neater, simpler way to program these
 * repetitive tasks: "for loops". If you've yet to learn about
 * for loops, either ask your professor, or take to Google!
 * 
 * Step 3: Change your code to use for loops instead
