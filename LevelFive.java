 *** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ***
 *                                                                             *
 * For loops are often very useful, but they're a pain to type out. If only we *
 * could just tell the rover how many steps we wanted it to take, and let the  *
 * rover take care of the hard work...                                         *
 *                                                                             *
 * GOOD NEWS! We can absolutely do that - NU Rover is scheduled for an update. *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 1: Write some functions to automate the tedious tasks, try writing a   *
 *         function called moveRightThreeTimes().                              *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 2: Write a new function that takes a parameter, instead.               *
 * Hint:   FOR loops can be dynamic, rather than limited to a set number       *
 *                                                                             *
 * Step 3: Cruise around using your new functions                              *
 * Step 4: What other tasks can you automate?                                  *
